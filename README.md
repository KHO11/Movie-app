# Movie-app
A movie information application where the user types the name of a movie of their choice and it shows more details about the movie such as the rating and a small summary about the movie without too much spoilers. 

# Lessons learned
First time I learnt how to use API and how to implement it in this project used to provide details of movies being searched by the user. 

# Possible future features 
Potentially while the user searches for the name of a movie, could maybe add more images at the start of maybe change the colour of the background to look better and more appealing.
